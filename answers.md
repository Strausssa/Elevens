1) Remove 5 spade 6 clubs or
5 club 6 club

2) Yes because every time two cards are removed unless if it is a J, Q, and K together. The amount of cards remaining on the board without there being a full J, Q, and K will always be an even number, otherwise there is a full J, Q, and K.

3) This game does not involve any strategy because none of the pairs of cards that add to eleven overlap. Luck!
